#compiler methods are no longer coming through to wasm
this is an issue for things like write_string_unsynchronized
WriteFile -> s32 #foreign kernel32; also not supported anymore

neither are #intrinsic methods but some of those are ok, like memcpy works on its own

set up the load/read calls so they remain sync for the caller while being async as much as possible in the client
